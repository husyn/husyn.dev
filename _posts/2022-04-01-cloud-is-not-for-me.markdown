For some Cloud is an apparent truth. For others it is unknown territory which is yet to be matured or explored by them. We as humans are always afraid of unknowns and when the change impacts hundreds or thousands of people where majority of them are not exposed to the destination then it really is scary. 

This [post by computerworld](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2488892/afraid-of-the-cloud--how-to-handle-your-fears.html) from **2014** discusses about fear attached to cloud computing. Concerns like transparency, absolute dependency, hidden metrics about compute processes and costing. Here's another one [post](https://www.masterdc.com/blog/five-common-fears-of-the-cloud-what-is-cloud-computing/) from **2015** talking about five fears about Cloud. The post shares valid points like Data Security, Accessibility, Cost, Lossing Control and Migrating back in case of failure.

But even in recent times the perception has not changed. It has improved but still many organisations fear this latest technolgy paradigm. A [blog by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/enterprise/cloud-fears-and-how-to-tackle-them) written in **2021** discusses issues like security, visibility and decentralizsed access, subscription costs, right tooling and controled workflows. 

I have seen many other issues like 
- Scarcity of experts
- Dependency on 3rd party AWS partners, vendors or AWS support
- Democritization of decisions
- Time

Out of the issues above, *time* is the most critical one. Quite a number of times, large organisations (through their employees) become comfortable in what they know. They don't want to go extra mile and explore new areas of advancements. In such organisations, Cloud is always an after thought. Some IT leader in management thinks that world is moving to cloud and we also should. And that's how many organisations start their cloud journey. Soon realizing that cloud is not mature enough, can't manage their load, is too costly, etc, etc. The issue here is the mindset changes rather than technical. 

Time is also critical in a way that the migrations and post-migrations improvements should be completed in months. Rarely that's the case. Large organisations approach this like: Cloud Discovery, Cost/Feasibility/Other Analysis, Business Use-cases, Solutions Intents, Business buy-in presentations, budget approvals, security approvals, etc. All this luggage of past era is what cloud is NOT suitable for. 

Cost is another very scary part of cloud computing. Especially in third world countries which are late majority or laggards [Ref on terms](https://ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/). The issue here is that of approach and learning from the industry. You don't have to start every project on EC2 & after maintaining it for x years realize that it should be serverless. The team has to be made up of passionate people who like to explore, join meetups, read blogs, etc. They'll be the ones who will be coming up with ideas eventually bringing the cost down.

The final fear according to me is *how to manage the cloud*. This is a genuine issue and should be really given deep thoughts. To start with cloud is really simple but to master it is the real challenge. It's the same as playing [Flappy Bird](https://flappybird.io/) game. It is super easy to start & even a 1 year old can play it. You just have to tap the screen to play. But to master it, yeah that's a totally different level.
